# ASM_Raspberry
Assembly snippets for Raspberry Pi

Assmebly has always been a small interest of mine and I have been dangling with a few different microcrocontrollers. Mainly PICs really, and I must admit, It is also there I so far have found the most benefit of the langugage.
However, rather lately opening the doors to Raspberry Pis, Orange Pis and other single-board-computers, I thought I'd try to take the opportunity to get a bit of a deeper understanding of both the platform and the programming languange.
